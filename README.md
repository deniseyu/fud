[Beef Shin Ragu](http://chelseawinter.co.nz/beef-shin-ragu/) Make sure to use a full-bodied, not-too-sweet red wine for this. I would also add 1 cup more of stock, since it dries up in the oven.

### Pork

### Seafood

### Noodles/Pasta

[Kale Pesto](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2872687/kale-pesto)

[Baked Ziti](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/11758/baked-ziti-i/)

I substitute ricotta cheese for sour cream, omit the onions (and usually the
meat), and use either Bertolli's vodka sauce or make my own.

[Heston Blumenthal's Mac and Cheese](http://www.insearchofheston.com/2013/02/heston-v-hawksmoor-macaroni-cheese/)

[Mushroom Bolognese](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/02/pasta-rich-hearty-mushroom-bolognese-recipe.html)

I ended up not using nut milk, and instead of miso I used two stock pots (one mushroom flavored and one vegetable flavored). This involves a LOT of chopping time, highly recommend using a food processor!
