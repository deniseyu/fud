[Xian famous spicy cumin lamb hand-smashed noodles](http://ladyandpups.com/2015/03/04/my-xian-famous-spicy-cumin-lamb-hand-smashed-noodles/)

[Beef Shin Ragu](http://chelseawinter.co.nz/beef-shin-ragu/) Make sure to use a full-bodied, not-too-sweet red wine for this. I would also add 1 cup more of stock, since it dries up in the oven.

### Pork

Belly](http://thewoksoflife.com/2014/04/shanghai-style-braised-pork-belly/)

[Ants climbing tree](https://thewoksoflife.com/ants-climbing-a-tree/) - A Sichuanese classic that has nothing to do with ants or trees

### Seafood

### Noodles/Pasta

[Penne Alla Rose](http://thewoksoflife.com/2016/07/penne-alla-rose/)

[Kale Pesto](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2872687/kale-pesto)

[Baked Ziti](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/11758/baked-ziti-i/)

I substitute ricotta cheese for sour cream, omit the onions (and usually the
meat), and use either Bertolli's vodka sauce or make my own.

[Heston Blumenthal's Mac and Cheese](http://www.insearchofheston.com/2013/02/heston-v-hawksmoor-macaroni-cheese/)

[Mushroom Bolognese](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/02/pasta-rich-hearty-mushroom-bolognese-recipe.html)

I ended up not using nut milk, and instead of miso I used two stock pots (one mushroom flavored and one vegetable flavored). This involves a LOT of chopping time, highly recommend using a food processor!

[Beef & Pork Bolognese](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/12/basic-ragu-bolognese-recipe.html)

[Dumpling Galaxy's Dumpling Wrapper Recipe](http://www.designsponge.com/2017/02/in-the-kitchen-with-dumpling-galaxys-spicy-beef-dumplings.html) - haven't made the spicy beef filling, but the wrapper goes great with boiled or pan-fried dumplings!

### Vegetables

[Smacked Cucumber
Salad](http://thewoksoflife.com/2015/06/smashed-asian-cucumber-salad/)

[Bean Sprout Salad](http://www.elinluv.com/2016/06/mung-bean-sprout-side-dish-sukjunamul.html)

[Aloo Gobi](https://www.thespruce.com/aloo-matar-gobi-cauliflower-peas-potatoes-1957954) - I added some carrots for some extra sweetness.


### Thanksgivings, Christmases, and other roast dinner occasions

[Sage & sausage stuffing](https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-sage-and-sausage-stuffing-or-dressing-recipe) - works well if you don't have sausage too!

[Reverse seared prime rib](https://www.seriouseats.com/perfect-prime-rib-beef-recipe)

[Red wine braised short rib](https://www.seriouseats.com/red-wine-braised-beef-short-ribs-recipe) - I don't bother with the port reduction. One time I added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the resulting sauce and it came out great.
